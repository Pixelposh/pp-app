    </p>
    <h3>1.2. Legal Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      These PixelPosh.com Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms of Use</strong>”),
      together with such additional terms which specifically apply to some of
      our services and features as presented on the PixelPosh.com website
      (“<strong>PixelPosh Website</strong>”, and collectively – the “<strong

      respect thereto, except where we explicitly state otherwise (all services
      offered through the PixelPosh Website – the “<strong
        >PixelPosh Services</strong
      >” or “<strong>Services</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      The PixelPosh Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract
      between PixelPosh.com. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries
      worldwide (“<strong>PixelPosh</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or
      “<strong>we</strong>”) and you in relation to the use of any PixelPosh
      Services - so please read them carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may visit and/or use the PixelPosh Services only if you fully agree to
      the PixelPosh Terms - and by using and/or registering to any of the
      PixelPosh Services, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these

      By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy
      Policy available at
      <router-link class="text-pp-red underline" to="/privacy">
        https://PixelPosh.com/privacy.
      </router-link>
      (“Privacy Policy”).
    </p>
    <h3>1.3. User Account</h3>
    <p>
      In order to access and use certain sections and features of the PixelPosh
      Services, you must first register and create an account with PixelPosh
      (“User Account”).
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of
      your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to
      you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the PixelPosh Services),
      make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any
      legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties
      and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your
      behalf and in your name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of
      your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you
      trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities
      that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for
      any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or
      not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or
      losses that may result from such activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your
      User Account and using the PixelPosh Services, to which you are the sole
      and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own
      (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid
      e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and
      true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below)
      submitted to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to
      determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment,
      whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us.
      However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole
      discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User
      Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution,
      without liability to you or to any other party. We may request
      documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may
      assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the
      principles set forth below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        PixelPosh will consider the owner of a
        <strong>User Account, User Platform and/or User Content</strong> created
        and/or uploaded to the relevant PixelPosh Service, as the person or
        entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in PixelPosh’s
        records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User
        Content was created.
      </li>
      <li>
        If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via
        a User Account, PixelPosh will consider the owner of such User Account
        and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created
        thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing
        details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“<strong
          >Billing Information</strong
        >”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform
        was connected to an external domain name and such domain’s registration
        information is publicly available via the WHOIS database provided on the
        <a href="https://www.whois.net/" target="_blank">www.whois.net</a>
        website or on PixelPosh’s database, PixelPosh will consider the owner of
        such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant
        of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an
        organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant
        organization of such domain, PixelPosh will consider the organization as
        the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User
        Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information
        indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain
        registration indicates a different owner, PixelPosh shall consider the
        person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the PixelPosh
        Account as the owner of the User Platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        Notwithstanding the forgoing, PixelPosh shall have the right to
        determine the ownership of User Content and/or a User Website as it
        chooses, including by ignoring the indications set forth above, in event
        PixelPosh deems, at its sole discretion, that the situation justifies
        such determination, all based upon the factual situation as determined
        by PixelPosh.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Certain parts of the PixelPosh Services (including certain Third Party
      Services available therein, as further explained in Section 8 below)
      require or involve the submission, collection and/or use of certain
      personally identifying or identifiable information. In particular and as a
      part of accessing or using the PixelPosh Services, PixelPosh and such
      Third Party Services may collect, access and use certain data pertaining
      to Users and End Users, including the activities or navigation undertaken
      by Users and End Users through the PixelPosh Services and/or User
      Platforms. We encourage you to read our Privacy Policy and each such Third
      Party Services’ relevant policies on a regular basis, for a description of
      such data collection and use practices.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Service Fees</h2>
    <h3>5.1. Paid Services</h3>
    <p>
      The use of certain PixelPosh Services may be subject to payment of
      particular fees, as determined by PixelPosh in its sole discretion
      (“<strong>Paid Services</strong>” and “<strong>Fee(s)</strong>”,
      respectively). PixelPosh will provide notice of such Fees then in effect
      in relation to such Paid Services. If you wish to receive or use such Paid
      Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      PixelPosh reserves the right to change its Fees at any time, upon notice
      to you if such change may affect your existing subscriptions. If you
      received a discount or other promotional offer, PixelPosh shall have the
      right to automatically and without notice renew your subscription to such
      PixelPosh Service(s) at the full applicable Fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Fees shall be deemed to be in Euros, except as specifically stated
      otherwise in writing by PixelPosh. To the extent permitted by law (and
      unless specified otherwise by PixelPosh in writing), all Fees are
      exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and
      services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities
      (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”), and you shall be responsible for payment of
      all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the PixelPosh Services, or to
      any payments or purchases made by you. If PixelPosh is obligated to
      collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such
      Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such
      Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be
      reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you
      verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third
      parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection
      with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency
      exchange fees or fees due to banks or credit card companies). PixelPosh is
      not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of registering or submitting information to receive Paid Services,
      you also authorize PixelPosh (either directly or through its affiliates,
      subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment and
      service fees (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing
      actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and
      to make any inquiries PixelPosh or its affiliates may consider necessary
      to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in
      order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving
      updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account
      provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to
      us by your credit card company).
    </p>
    <h3>5.2. Invoices</h3>
    <p>
      PixelPosh and/or its affiliated companies will issue an invoice or credit
      memo for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by PixelPosh
      (“<strong>Invoice</strong>”). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic
      form and based on the country stated in your billing address, and will be
      made available to you via your User Account and/or by e-mail. For the
      purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain
      Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in
      order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in
      your User Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and
      in such case may be used for pro forma purposes only.
    </p>
    <h3>5.3. Subscription Auto-Renewals</h3>
    <p>
      In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of
      services, certain Paid Services include an automatic renewal option by
      default, according to which, unless you turn-off the auto-renewal option,
      such Paid Services will automatically renew upon the end of the applicable
      subscription period, for a renewal period equal in time to the original
      subscription period (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise
      notified to you, at the same price (subject to applicable Taxes changes
      and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the
      first period) (“<strong>Renewing Paid Services</strong>”). For example, if
      the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its
      renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Accordingly,
      where applicable, PixelPosh will attempt to automatically charge you the
      applicable Fees using the Stored Card, within up-to two (2) weeks before
      such renewal period commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees
      owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to)
      retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User
      Account, without further notice. If your Renewing Paid Service is subject
      to a yearly or multiple-year subscription period, PixelPosh will endeavor
      to provide you a notice prior to the renewal of such Paid Service at least
      thirty (30) days in advance of the renewal date.
    </p>
    <p>
      By entering into this Agreement and by purchasing a Renewing Paid Service,
      you acknowledge and agree that the Renewing Paid Service shall
      automatically renew in accordance with the above terms.
    </p>
    <h3>5.4. Refunds</h3>
    <p>
      Services purchased on or through the PixelPosh Services may be
      non-refundable. The terms of each purchased service or application are
      indicated on the PixelPosh Website and/or as part of or during the process
      of purchasing such services or applications. It is your obligation to
      verify your ability to cancel a service prior to purchasing it. PixelPosh
      will not refund any amounts paid for non-refundable Paid Services,
      applications or Third Party Services. PixelPosh provides a free version
      for testing User Content or PixelPosh Services before any payments or
      subscriptions are purchased
    </p>
    <h3>5.5. Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>
      If, at any time, we record a decline, chargeback or other rejection of a
      charge of any payable Fees on your PixelPosh account
      (“<strong>Chargeback</strong>”), this will be considered as a breach of
      your payment obligations hereunder, and your use of the PixelPosh Services
      may be automatically disabled or terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked
      without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in
      such User Account, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to
      cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your use of the PixelPosh Services will not resume until you re-subscribe
      for any such PixelPosh Services, and pay any applicable Fees in full,
      including any fees and expenses incurred by PixelPosh and/or any Third
      Party Services for each Chargeback received (including Fees for PixelPosh
      Services provided prior to the Chargeback, handling and processing charges
      and fees incurred by the payment processor).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to
      PixelPosh, we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team
      before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment, in order to prevent the
      PixelPosh Services from being cancelled and your User Account being
      blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous
      Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees,
      in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the PixelPosh
      Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by
      providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with
      any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for
      such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the
      services rendered thereafter.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Cancellations</h2>
    <h3>6.1. Cancellation by User</h3>
    <p>
      You may discontinue to use and request to cancel your User Account and/or
      any PixelPosh Services at any time, in accordance with the instructions
      available on the PixelPosh Services. The effective date and time for such
      cancellation shall be the date and time on which you have completed the
      cancellation process on the PixelPosh Services, and the effective date for
      cancellation of Paid Services shall be at the end of such Paid Services’
      subscription period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, with respect to
      subscriptions to Renewing Paid Services, such subscription will be
      discontinued only upon the expiration of the respective period for which
      you have already made payment. Please note that as the cancellation
      process may take a few days, in order to avoid the next automatic renewal
      and respective charge the cancellation request should be made at least
      fourteen (14) days prior to the expiration of the then-current service
      period.
    </p>
    <h3>6.2. Cancellation by PixelPosh</h3>
    <p>
      Failure to comply with any of the PixelPosh Terms and/or to pay any due
      Fee shall entitle PixelPosh to suspend (until full payment is made) or
      cancel your User Account and User Platform (or certain features thereof),
      as well as the provision of any related PixelPosh Services (e.g., Paid
      Services) or Third Party Services to you.
    </p>
    <h3>6.3. Loss of Data, Content and Capacity</h3>
    <p>
      If your User Account or any PixelPosh Services or Third Party Services
      related to your User Account are cancelled (whether at your request or at
      PixelPosh’s discretion), it may cause or result in the loss of certain
      content, features, or capacity of your User Account, including any User
      Content, End User data or other usage data retained therein in the such
      Services (“<strong>Capacity Loss</strong>”). PixelPosh shall not be liable
      in any way for such Capacity Loss, or for saving a backup of your User
      Account, User Content or End User data. Please also note that additional
      Fees may apply to re-activation of a User Account and/or any PixelPosh
      Services following their cancellation, as determined by PixelPosh in its
      sole discretion.

    <h3>11.3. Relationship</h3>
    <p>
      The PixelPosh Terms, and your use of the PixelPosh Services, do not, and
      shall not be construed to create any partnership, joint venture,
      employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship between
      PixelPosh and you.
    </p>
    <h3>11.4. Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use, together with the PixelPosh Terms and any other legal
      or fee notices provided to you by PixelPosh, shall constitute the entire
      agreement between you and PixelPosh concerning the subject matter hereof
      or thereof, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements,
      understandings, promises, conditions, negotiations, covenants or
      representations, whether written or oral, between PixelPosh and you,
      including those made by or between any of our respective representatives,
      with respect to any of the PixelPosh Services. You further agree that you
      are not relying upon any promise, inducement, representation, statement,
      disclosure or duty of disclosure of PixelPosh in entering into any of the
      PixelPosh Terms.
    </p>
    <h3>11.5. Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      PixelPosh may assign its rights and/or obligations hereunder and/or
      transfer ownership rights and title in the PixelPosh Services and/or
      Licensed Content to a third party without your consent or prior notice to
      you. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights and obligations
      hereunder without the prior written consent of PixelPosh. Any attempted or
      actual assignment thereof without PixelPosh’s prior explicit and written
      consent will be null and void. In any event, an assignment or transfer
      pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall not in itself grant either PixelPosh
      or you the right to cancel any PixelPosh Services or Third Party Services
      then in effect.
    </p>
    <h3>11.6. Severability &amp; Waivers</h3>
    <p>
      If any provision of the PixelPosh Terms is deemed by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, void, or for any reason
      unenforceable, then such provision shall be deemed severable and will not
      affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. No
      Waiver of any breach or default of any of the PixelPosh Terms shall be
      deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
    </p>
    <h3>11.7. Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use were written in English, and translated into other
      languages for your convenience. You may access and view other language
      versions by changing your PixelPosh Website language settings. If a
      translated (non-English) version of these Terms of Use conflicts in any

    </h2>
    <p>

      General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), we are a ‘data
      controller’ of your personal information.

    <h2>How you can access your personal information</h2>
    <p>

      transfer in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to
      you), to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights to
      object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such

      this consent as more fully described below.

    <p>
      These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can

      even if you withdraw your consent.
    </p>

      Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or
      contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such
      data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual
      relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other
      cases, provision of requested personal information is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to
      data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will
      be the data protection authority of the country: (i) of your habitual
      residence; (ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the
      alleged infringement has occurred.
